A prince is in the search of a princess to marry. But whenever he meets one, something goes wrong and he fails to find a suitable alliance. One evening, there is a thunderstorm and a young lady, who is fully drenched, knocks on the castle door. She seeks shelter in the princeâ€™s castle.


The young lady claims to be a princess and requests the king and the queen to allow her to spend the night in the castle. As her appearance is distressed and worn out, nobody believes her.
